  Shut is a tool to manage the lifecycle of pure Python packages. It automates tasks such
  as bootstrapping a project, bumping version numbers, managing changelogs and publishing
  packages to PyPI all the while performing sanity checks.

  Shut makes strong assumptions on the project structure and assumes that the source-control
  system of choice is Git.
